3-6.The average-grade computation in § 3.1/36 might divide by zero if the student didn’t enter
any grades. Division by zero is undefined in C++, which means that the implementation is
permitted to do anything it likes. What does your C++ implementation do in this case?
Rewrite the program so that its behavior does not depend on how the implementation treats
division by zero.


ANSWER:
Compiling with GCC on GNU/Linux returns -nan (not a number) when dividing by zero.
